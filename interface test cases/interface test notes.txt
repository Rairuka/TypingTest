on running, i realised values inputed into the textedit1 box didn't concatenate properly into my empty vector corWords.

later realised that i needed guidata(hObjects,handles) to save the inputs to handles

on making interface, i accidently put a box somewhere and i couldn't get rid of it. Therefore i started again from scratch

making plot button work took a while
first i plotted it and it came out ok but i wanted to edit the axis limits
in doing so it shows two labels and axis labels overlapping making not readable
using my pong file from my spare time i looked at the format and manage to get the plot button to work correctly


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

since for loops didn't work, i had to figure out a way to keep generating values
therefore on enter press i made it execute a var(handle.words) with a random index to generate a new word


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

realised timers could only execute one function, this caused problems for calculation of wpm
in addition the calculations need the length of corWords and wroWords. lengths(x) didn't seem to work in the gui therefore i made counts
for each.

what if they get more wrong then correct? an error
find a fix with an if statement
