In this project you have to develop an application that:

Reads input, and (input from user typing in words)
Performs some interesting computation based on that input. (finding wpm)
 

The code that you use to produce that application must use a combination of at least two of:

Loops (contantly generating words to type and input)
Vectors or Arrays (constanting concatenating)
Conditional execution (comparing words?)**
Optionally, your code might embed:

Functions.  (timer?)**
Visualisation of data (making stats based on amount of tries, to show improvement etc)
